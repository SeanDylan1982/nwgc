# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical need for reliable database communication in the neighborhood watch application. The current MongoDB setup needs optimization to ensure consistent and reliable connections. The solution involves implementing robust connection management, error handling, and data synchronization patterns to ensure maximum reliability and performance while continuing to use MongoDB as the database system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a robust MongoDB connection management system so that the application maintains stable and reliable database connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to MongoDB with proper configuration for reliability
2. WHEN network fluctuations occur THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect using exponential backoff
3. WHEN connection pools are exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and handle them gracefully
4. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have reliable database connections so that every page loads consistently without connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the database connection SHALL be available and responsive
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be wrapped in proper error handling and retry logic
3. WHEN multiple database operations are needed THEN they SHALL be properly batched or use transactions where appropriate
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback to users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time data updates on every page so that I always see the most current information without manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes in the database THEN all connected clients SHALL receive updates within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user performs an action THEN the UI SHALL reflect the change immediately with optimistic updates
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN pending changes SHALL be synchronized automatically
4. WHEN multiple users modify the same data THEN conflicts SHALL be resolved consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive connection monitoring and health checks so that database issues can be detected and resolved proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL continuously monitor MongoDB connection health
2. WHEN connection metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL log warnings and take corrective action
3. WHEN database performance degrades THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts with diagnostic information
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before escalating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms so that temporary database issues don't cause application failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff strategies
2. WHEN connection pools are exhausted THEN requests SHALL be queued with timeout handling
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency through proper error handling
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably in production environments so that the neighborhood watch system is always available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed to production THEN the MongoDB connection SHALL use secure, encrypted connections
2. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the connection pool SHALL scale appropriately to handle load
3. WHEN maintenance windows occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle planned downtime
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN database backups SHALL be available and restorable
