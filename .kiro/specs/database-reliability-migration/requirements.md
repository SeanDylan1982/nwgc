# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical need for reliable database communication in the neighborhood watch application. The current MongoDB setup lacks the reliability and consistency required for an application where users need real-time updates on every page. The solution involves migrating to PostgreSQL (specifically Neon) and implementing robust connection management, error handling, and data synchronization patterns to ensure maximum reliability and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from MongoDB to PostgreSQL so that the application has better data consistency, ACID compliance, and more reliable connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to a PostgreSQL database instead of MongoDB
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL maintain ACID properties for data integrity
3. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the database SHALL handle transactions without data corruption
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data SHALL be preserved and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have reliable database connections so that every page loads consistently without connection errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the database connection SHALL be available and responsive
2. WHEN database connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN connection pools are exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and handle them gracefully
4. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time data updates on every page so that I always see the most current information without manual refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes in the database THEN all connected clients SHALL receive updates within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user performs an action THEN the UI SHALL reflect the change immediately with optimistic updates
3. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN pending changes SHALL be synchronized automatically
4. WHEN multiple users modify the same data THEN conflicts SHALL be resolved consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive connection monitoring and health checks so that database issues can be detected and resolved proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL continuously monitor database connection health
2. WHEN connection metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL log warnings and take corrective action
3. WHEN database performance degrades THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts with diagnostic information
4. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before escalating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms so that temporary database issues don't cause application failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff strategies
2. WHEN connection pools are exhausted THEN requests SHALL be queued with timeout handling
3. WHEN transactions fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and maintain data consistency
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably in production environments so that the neighborhood watch system is always available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed to production THEN the database connection SHALL use secure, encrypted connections
2. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the connection pool SHALL scale appropriately to handle load
3. WHEN maintenance windows occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle planned downtime
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN database backups SHALL be available and restorable
