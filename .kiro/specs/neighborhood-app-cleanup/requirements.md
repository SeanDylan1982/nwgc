# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and standardizing the neighbourhood watch app's backend and frontend data handling. The goal is to eliminate all hardcoded mock data, implement proper dynamic rendering from the database, enable missing features, and enhance user interactivity. This comprehensive cleanup will transform the app from a prototype with mock data into a fully functional, database-driven application with improved UI/UX, notifications, and legal compliance.
