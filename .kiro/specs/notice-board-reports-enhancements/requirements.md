# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical missing functionality where creation forms are not displaying properly. The Notice Board has a "Post Notice" button that works correctly, but the Reports section is missing a "New Report" button in the top right corner. Additionally, FAB buttons currently only navigate to pages but don't trigger the creation forms to open automatically. Both sections have the form dialogs implemented but they're not being triggered properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community member, I want consistent "New" buttons in the top right corner of both Notice Board and Reports sections, so that I can easily create new content with a familiar interface pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the Notice Board page THEN the system SHALL display a "Post Notice" button in the top right corner
2. WHEN a user visits the Reports page THEN the system SHALL display a "New Report" button in the top right corner with consistent styling
3. WHEN a user clicks either "Post Notice" or "New Report" button THEN the system SHALL open the respective creation form modal
4. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN both buttons SHALL be appropriately sized and positioned for touch interaction
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the buttons SHALL either be hidden or show appropriate login prompts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community member, I want FAB (Floating Action Button) functionality that opens new instances of their respective sections, so that I can quickly access create functionality from anywhere in the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Chat FAB button THEN the system SHALL open a new chat instance or chat creation interface
2. WHEN a user clicks the Notice FAB button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Notice Board section and open the create notice form
3. WHEN a user clicks the Report FAB button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the Reports section and open the create report form
4. WHEN FAB buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL maintain proper navigation state and allow users to return to their previous location
5. IF a user is already in the target section THEN the FAB SHALL directly open the creation form without navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the Reports section to have a prominent "New Report" button that matches the Notice Board's "Post Notice" button design, so that I have a consistent experience across both sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the Reports page THEN the system SHALL display a "New Report" button in the top right corner
2. WHEN the "New Report" button is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same styling, positioning, and behavior as the "Post Notice" button
3. WHEN a user clicks the "New Report" button THEN the system SHALL open the report creation modal dialog
4. WHEN the button is viewed on different screen sizes THEN it SHALL maintain consistent responsive behavior
5. IF the user lacks permissions to create reports THEN the button SHALL be disabled with appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a community member, I want both notice and report creation forms to have proper validation and user feedback, so that I can successfully submit well-formatted content without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to submit an incomplete form THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors for each missing or invalid field
2. WHEN a user successfully submits a notice or report THEN the system SHALL show a success message and the new item SHALL appear at the top of the respective list immediately
3. WHEN a user cancels form creation THEN the system SHALL clear all form data and close the modal
4. WHEN form submission fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and keep the form data intact for retry
5. IF required fields are empty THEN the submit button SHALL be disabled with visual indication of what's missing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a community member, I want consistent navigation and state management when using FAB buttons and create forms, so that I can seamlessly move between sections while maintaining my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a FAB button from any section THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate section and automatically open the creation form
2. WHEN a user completes form creation THEN the system SHALL maintain proper navigation history for back button functionality
3. WHEN a user cancels form creation via FAB navigation THEN the system SHALL return them to their previous location
4. WHEN multiple creation forms are accessed in sequence THEN the system SHALL properly manage form state and prevent conflicts
5. IF a user navigates away during form creation THEN the system SHALL handle cleanup appropriately without memory leaks
