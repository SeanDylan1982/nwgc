# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature standardizes the group chat interface to match the private chat interface design and enhances it with interactive messaging capabilities, improved user experience elements, and better visual feedback. The enhancements focus on making group conversations more engaging and user-friendly by unifying the chat experience, adding message interactions, proper sender identification, member information display, and attachment support.
