  - Test MessageInteractions hover behavior and interaction handling
  - Add tests for reply context preservation and display
  - Test reaction toggle functionality and state management
  - Create tests for member tooltip and sender identification logic
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 12. Write integration tests for real-time features
